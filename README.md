# Road to Surface Duo Xamarin App (#rTsd)
> This is a work in progress [Xamarin.Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) Android project which is intended to feature most of the new features that makes the upcoming [Microsoft Surface Duo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-duo) phone unique. It will use the awesome German [Dr. Windows](https://www.drwindows.de)  as data source for its articles.

## tl;dr
This is neither an offical [Dr. Windows](https://www.drwindows.de) app nor anything other than a highly motivated playground to dive deep into the Xamarin.Forms ecosystem with a dedicated usecase in mind.

It will target only Android devices and it's meant to include all other aspecs of Xamarin development such as a configurared continuous integration and analytics powerd by the [Azure App Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-center/).

This project is written and owned by a beginner and meant for beginners. It would be perfect if experts could mentor the project - but this is just a mind in the clouds.

If you are looking for the siblings app that's based on the UWP ecosystem to work with the Surface Neo, please see the GitHub repository [tscholze/uwp-road-to-surface-neo](https://github.com/tscholze/uwp-road-to-surface-neo). This project is currently on hold due to some emulator requirements that I cannot fulfill at the ment.

## Structure

**rTsd**

Xamarin.Forms container that includes all shared functionality and features.

**rTsd.Android**

Android wrapper and platform-specifc implementations like custom rendereres, effects or assets.

## Phases

- [x] Finding a usecase

- [x] Write an email to `dualscreendev@microsoft.com` to get soon(tm) more information
- [x] Concept roughly an user interface
- [x] Get the project (template) up and running
- [x] Getting into important Xamarin / C# pattern
- [x] Write first MVP code
- [x] Implement first Surface Duo related features or layouts
- [x] Improve feature and code quality
- [x] Run it on a Surface Duo emulator
- [x] Add user opt-in for non Dr. Windows server requests
- [x] Add localization (resx)
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Leverage CI with tests and deployments
- [ ] Run it on an actual Surface Duo device

## Prerequirements
- Windows 10 / macOS 
- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (for Mac)
- Installed Xamarin Visual Studio plugins

## Assumption
- The Surface Duo will usw two navigation pages, master on the left screen and detail on the right, as the main indicator how to display an app on two screens -> Nope it works a little bit diffrent

## Other programms I used
- Microsoft [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) as information storage around the idea of the app
- Microsoft [Teams](https://products.office.com/en-US/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) to clarify open question with the Dr. Windows team
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for all, except source code editing, writings like mark down files
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for Git operations outside of Visual Studio
- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/xd.html) to protoyp the UI

## Features
- Good looking, hopefully (in my opinion)
- Utilizes Surface Duo features
- Utilizes App Center features
- Ticker with latest tweets of [@drwindows_de](https://twitter.com/drwindows_de)
- Lists articles of [Dr. Windows](https://www.drwindows.de) 
- Lists videos of [Dr. Windows Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DrWindowsTV)
- Detail article view
- Share functionality

## UI concepts
I'm not a skilled user interface designer nor I have an eye for beauty, but the app should look mostly like the following concepts.

I used the free, but required an Adobe ID, application [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/xd.html) to create the protoyp views.

## Decisions made 
- Using the `Page.Navigation(...)` feature instead of the new url-based `Shell.GoToAsync(...)`
- Using the native asset management instead of the embedded images one. The not successful feature implementation can be found via: `deadend/embedded-images`

## Keep in mind
This app is purely build for having fun! All features have room for improvements or could be done more elegant.
